# ViewShare

ViewShare uses crowdsourcing to enable a user to find objects in cluttered environments. A user who is blind can open ViewShare and request to find an object. A user who is sighted can click on objects they are told to find in pictures. The app uses ARKit to localize the objects for the user who is blind.
